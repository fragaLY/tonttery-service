## Bandwidth, Latency, and Throughput

Typical latencies:
- Reading 1 MB from RAM: 0.25 ms
- Reading 1 MB from SSD: 1 ms
- Transfer 1 MB over network: 10 ms
- Reading 1 MB from HDD: 20 ms
- Inter-continental round trip: 150 ms

Taking in advance the targeted transactions per second that should be handled ~10_000, we can calculate the latency by default in non-cached request at max
? ms.
